			<h2>About Me</h2><br>
			<p>Hello everyone. I'm Adam and I'm a web developer. Right now I mainly specialize in the front-end aspect, however I do backend work as well. I love web development because it gives me the ability to create something special. Websites are among the most important things we can have to promote ourselves. With websites many companies are able to attract customers and clients from around the world. Websites allow us to make money online with payment options, we get to meet and communicate from far distances, and many more things. So knowing that I can help someone in such a drastic way makes me feel great. I've always been interested in computers but I admit, I didn't always know if I'd be able to code or build websites. I never thought too deep into it. I sort of just relegated web development as something for the rich geniuses. <br> <br> However, I eventually began to find out that I too could become a web developer. I was always studying something online and looking for things to keep me entertained. Then I became fascinated with some of the recent technologies like virtual reality and high tech video games. I wanted to build them. So I began researching the different languages that I would have to learn. Along the way I realized I had an interest in websites. I learned that websites can be very interesting and interactive. I began studying really hard and learning the languages necessary to build websites and apps.. In this website I will list some of my personal projects. I hope you enjoy!</p>
